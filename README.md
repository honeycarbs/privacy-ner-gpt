I made a little backend for us!
**How to install**
First, if you are using vscode, cmd + shift + P -> "Python: create an environment" --> Venv --> python 3.9 (the only version that is good for Presidio)

Then:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then launch the main file.

It runs on http://localhost:5000, swagger file is http://localhost:5000/api/v1/doc
